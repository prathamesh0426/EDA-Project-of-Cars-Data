# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Cars Dataset

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a cars dataset to uncover insights, detect patterns, and visualize relationships among key automotive features. The analysis involves cleaning, preprocessing, and visualizing data to better understand the factors influencing car attributes such as price, mileage, engine capacity, horsepower, and more.

 ## Project Objectives

Perform data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers).

Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

Visualize distributions, correlations, and trends in the dataset.

Identify key factors influencing car pricing and performance.

Generate insights for data-driven decision-making in the automobile industry.

## Tools & Libraries Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook for analysis & documentation

## Key Insights

Distribution of car prices and mileage across different categories

Correlation between engine size, horsepower, and car price

Impact of fuel type, transmission, and brand on vehicle performance

Outlier detection and treatment for more accurate insights

## Repository Structure

EDA Project of Cars.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step EDA

data/ → Dataset used for analysis (if included)

images/ → Visualization outputs (optional)

## Future Scope

Apply feature engineering for predictive modeling

Build machine learning models for car price prediction

Extend analysis with larger or real-world datasets
